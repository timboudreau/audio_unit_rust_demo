This marker file tells our cbindgen wrapper to replace, e.g.

#include "foo.h"

with

#include <foo.h>

because it appears that when used as Framework headers from a
module map, Xcode wants C++ semantics, but we still need C semantics
for functions that return structs.  So we generate that and then
rewrite the includes to meet its expectations.

There is probably some incantation of compiler config and cbindgen
config that will avoid this, but it will do for now.
